## What is a portfolio, and why is it necessary?

### Cybersecurity professionals use portfolios to demonstrate their security education, skills, and knowledge. 
### Professionals typically use portfolios when they apply for jobs to show potential employers that they are
### passionate about their work and can do the job they are applying for. Portfolios are more in depth than a resume,
### which is typically a one-to-two page summary of relevant education, work experience, and accomplishments. 
### You will have the opportunity to develop a resume, and finalize your portfolio, in the last course of this program.
